# INSTRUCTOR FEEDBACK
# Task: Sort states.txt alphabetically and save it as a new file named states-sorted.txt
# 10/10 possible points
# Task: In states.txt, replace all occurrences of the letter a with the letter z and save it as a new file named stztes.txt
# 7/10 possible points
# Your command only changes the first a to z
# Use sed 's/a/z/g' states.txt to change all of them
# You need to also end with > stztes.txt to redirect the output
# to a new file instead of the terminal itself.
# Correct answer
# sed 's/a/z/g' states.txt > stztes.txt
# Task: Edit ~/.bash_profile and create an alias for the command ls -alt that equals l
# 10/10 possible points
# Type history > history.txt
# 10/10 possible points
